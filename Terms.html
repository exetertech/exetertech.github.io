    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead">1. About the Terms<div>1.1 What these Terms cover: These are our terms and conditions on which we supply technical services. They cover our support and repair of your personal equipment as well as our general privacy policy.</div><div>1.2 Definitions:&nbsp;</div><div>“Us” or “Engineer” refers to an employee of Exeter Technical Support.</div><div>“You” refers to a customer or client.</div><div>“Home” or “Property” refers to the place where you live or a location where a repair takes place.</div><div>“Service” or “Services” refers to any work carried out by an engineer of Exeter Technical Support.</div><div>“Equipment” refers to a personal belonging (for example a laptop computer) which a customer arranges a technical service for.</div><div>1.3 Customer Acknowledgement: By arranging any service with Exeter Technical Support, you are agreeing to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy as stated here.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Our contract with you</div><div>2.1 Start of Contract: Our contract begins when we receive equipment which requires service or when we attend your property for an at-home visit.</div><div>2.2. End of Contract: Our contract will end when a service has completed unless terminated, (see section 2.3).</div><div>2.3 Termination of Contract: A contract may be terminated by an engineer or by a customer.</div><div>i) Initial termination – If we cannot accept a service request, we reserve the right to terminate a contract. In this situation you will not be charged.&nbsp;</div><div>ii) An engineer can terminate a contract after a service begins (for example if they are at risk of injury or the service requested is impossible due to a scenario outside of our control). In this situation we may partially charge for services which have already been completed.</div><div>iii) You have a 14 day cooling off period in which you can terminate a contract without reason, as per your statutory rights. This cooling off period expires once we begin a service.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. Services</div><div>3.1 What our Services include: We provide services as detailed on our website (exetertechnicalsupport.co.uk) or as described by an engineer during an on-site visit/diagnosis. Changes can be made to the services, but only if agreed in writing or during an on-site visit by an engineer.</div><div>3.2 Service Timescales: Our timescales are estimates, we are not responsible for delays outside of our reasonable control (See section 5.6), however we will always aim to complete a service within the agreed timescale. Services without a pre-agreed timescale will be completed within a reasonable amount of time. Timescales are quoted in working days, and exclude bank holidays and public holidays. The timescale begins once we have access to the equipment and are in a position to begin a service.</div><div>3.3 Changes to Service: Services may change after our initial inspection (for example if we find an issue that was not described when the service was requested). In this situation the price of the service may increase or decrease but not without confirmation from the engineer and your agreement as a customer. See more information regarding this in section (4) “Pricing”.</div><div>3.4 Reasonable Care: Services will be carried out with reasonable care and will comply with the manufacturers specification where available.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Pricing and Payment</div><div>4.1 Quoted Price of Services: The price of our services will be as quoted on our website (exetertechnicalsupport.co.uk), or as confirmed by an engineer during an on-site visit. The prices are inclusive of all labour, parts and VAT.</div><div>4.2 Changes to Price: The price of a service can change if the service itself changes (See section 3.3). This may cause the price to increase or decrease but will only happen if confirmed by an engineer and if agreed to by you in advance.</div><div>4.3 Inspection Fees: We reserve the right to charge an inspection fee when diagnosing equipment and offering a quote for a repair service. This fee will not apply if the repair service goes ahead. The fee will also not apply if we determine the problem to be something that we cannot fix. Our inspection fee is £20.00.</div><div>4.4 Accepted Payment Types: We currently accept bank transfers, card payments (contactless or chip and pin) or cash payments.</div><div>4.5 When to Pay: Full payment must be made once the service has been completed. For set price services, payments can be made in advance.</div><div>4.6 Non-Payment: If you fail to pay a sum due to us under any contract on the due date of payment, you commit a material breach of this contract. If you fail to remedy this breach after being requested to do so, all sums across any existing contracts become immediately due. In this situation we are entitled to take one or any of the following actions:</div><div>i) Require payment in advance of any further services.</div><div>ii) Charge and recover interest from the customer on the sums outstanding at the rate of 4 percent above the Bank of England's set interest rate.&nbsp;</div><div>iii) Terminate the contract and any other existing contracts.</div><div>iv) Seek legal advice or take legal proceedings to enforce our rights under this contract, including but not limited to recovery of any sums due. You shall be required to reimburse our costs including legal costs in this situation.</div><div>4.7 Refunds: If we are unable to action a service, a refund will be offered. Our inspection fee may still apply (See section 4.3). A partial refund may be offered if some or any of the requested services are completed successfully, otherwise the refund will be for the full price paid.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>5. Responsibilities and Liabilities</div><div>5.1 Statutory rights: Your statutory rights as a customer are not affected by these terms. These terms do not exclude or restrict our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.</div><div>5.2 Negligence: We will make good any damage caused by an engineer to your equipment or property during service. This does not apply if any damage arises from fair wear and tear, or from any pre-existing damage/vulnerability (See “Existing Damage” section 5.5). Without prejudice to any other provisions stated here, our total liability for any one claim shall not exceed the price of the equipment and/or the services provided.</div><div>5.3 Refunds and Repeat Repairs: In a situation where you would be entitled to damages against us (other than in the exceptions stated here) we will aim to repair the equipment at our own expense or make good any negligence during a service by repeating a repair free of charge. If neither option is reasonably possible, we will credit all (or an appropriate part) of the price paid for relevant services or repairs.</div><div>5.4 Software and Data Loss: We are not liable for any software or data damages, whether they are direct or indirect (Including liability to a third party). We strongly recommend following proper data backup practices before arranging a service. While we will always apply reasonable skill and care; due to the nature of software and data, we can not guarantee that data will never be lost or damaged in some way. Whether this happens due to our negligence or otherwise, we cannot not be held liable.</div><div>5.5 Existing Damage: We are not liable for damage that arises as a result of existing faults or damage on your equipment. Existing small faults or vulnerabilities may worsen or grow as a result of our service, by arranging a service with us, you are accepting this risk.</div><div>5.6 Delays: If the engineer or you as a customer are delayed by reasons out of reasonable control (for example force majeure) then the service may be delayed to a reasonable time in the future. The affected party will not be held liable for such delays.</div><div>5.7 Business losses: We supply services for domestic and private use and as such we have no liability for loss of business, including but not limited to loss of profit, loss of wage and loss of business opportunity.</div><div><br></div><div>5.8 Operating Systems: We do not recommend running out of date operating systems due to the security risks that they pose. If a customer requires technical support we will be able to provide a reasonable amount of assistance, but will accept no liability for issues caused as a result of using an old or obsolete operating system. Windows systems prior to Windows 7 are no longer supported by Microsoft. Mac systems prior to 10.7 are no longer supported by Apple.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>6. General</div><div>6.1 General Contract Law: The construction, validity and performance of a Contract shall be governed and interpreted according to the Law of England and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts in any dispute or difference arising between the customer and us in relation to a Contract.</div><div>6.2 Headings: The headings in these terms are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation.</div><div>6.3 Contract Enforcement: Failure by us to enforce a term of a Contract as soon as it may be enforced shall not prevent the subsequent enforcement of that or any other term of the Contract.</div><div>6.4. Non Enforcement: The non-enforcement by us of any of the terms of a Contract shall not constitute a waiver unless this is stated by us in writing.</div><div>6.5 Unenforceable Clauses: If any clause or sub-clause of these Terms is held by a competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the other clauses and sub-clauses of these Terms shall not be affected and they shall remain in full effect.</div><div>6.6 Third Party Contractors: We may assign or sub contract all or any of our obligations under this contract to a competent third party.</div><div>6.7 Contract Termination: Termination of this contract shall not affect relevant rights and obligations.</div><div>6.8 Third Party Rights: A person (a “third party”) who is not a party to this Contract has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms, notwithstanding that any such term may purport to confer or may be construed as conferring a benefit on such third party. This does not affect any right or remedy of such third party, which exists or is available irrespective of the said Act.</div><div><br></div><div>7. Privacy Policy</div><div><br></div><div>We comply with the current UK Data Protection Act 1998 (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29) with regard to any personal information that we receive from you.</div><div>We will always aim to ensure that your privacy is kept protected. Any information that we receive, whether through our website (exetertechnicalsupport.co.uk) or otherwise, will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</div><div><br></div><div>Information that we collect and store:</div><div>Full name</div><div>Contact details, including full address, email address and phone number.</div><div>Service History with Exeter Technical Support</div><div>Decisions in regards to promotional offers or preferred contact methods.</div><div><br></div><div>We do not distribute, sell or lease any of this information to third parties unless we have your permission or if we are required by law to do so. With your permission, we may provide promotional information or marketing offers using contact details you have provided.</div></div>
